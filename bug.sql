The following SQL query attempts to use a subquery in the FROM clause to get a count of orders for each customer, but it fails because the subquery doesn't have an alias:

```sql
SELECT c.CustomerID, (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Orders WHERE CustomerID = c.CustomerID) AS OrderCount
FROM Customers c;
```

This will result in a syntax error in most SQL dialects. The subquery needs an alias to be used in the FROM clause.
