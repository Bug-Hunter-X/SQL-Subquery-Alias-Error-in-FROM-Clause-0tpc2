The solution is to simply add an alias to the subquery:

```sql
SELECT c.CustomerID, orderCounts.OrderCount
FROM Customers c
JOIN (SELECT CustomerID, COUNT(*) AS OrderCount FROM Orders GROUP BY CustomerID) AS orderCounts ON c.CustomerID = orderCounts.CustomerID;
```

This revised query uses a JOIN which is generally more efficient than a subquery in the SELECT clause for this type of operation.  The subquery is given the alias `orderCounts`, allowing it to be referenced in the main query. This approach is generally preferred for readability and efficiency.
